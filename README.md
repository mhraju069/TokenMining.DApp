RC Mining DApp 
RC Mining is a decentralized application (DApp) that allows users to mine tokens using a smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain. The DApp provides a user-friendly interface for wallet connection, mining, and token claiming functionalities. With a built-in progress bar and detailed transaction history, users can track their mining progress and claim rewards in real-time.

Features
Connect Wallet: Easily connect your wallet (e.g., MetaMask) to interact with the DApp.

Mining: Start mining tokens and track the progress through a visual progress bar.

Claim Tokens: After the mining session is complete, users can claim their mined tokens.

Transaction History: View detailed history of mining and claiming activities.

Real-Time Updates: The DApp provides real-time updates about the user's mining progress, balance, and session.

Technologies Used
Solidity: Smart contract development.

React: Frontend framework for building the user interface.

Ethereum: Blockchain network for token transactions.

Web3.js/Ethers.js: Libraries to interact with the Ethereum blockchain.

Hardhat: Development environment for Ethereum-based applications.

Installation
Prerequisites
Node.js (v14.x or later)

npm or yarn

MetaMask or any other Ethereum wallet extension

Step 1: Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/mhraju069/TokenMining.DApp

Step 2: Install Dependencies
npm install

Step 3: Configure the Smart Contract
Deploy the smart contract on your local or test Ethereum network.

Update the contract address in the frontend code (e.g., src/contract.js).

Step 4: Run the Development Server
npm start

Visit http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

Usage
Connect Wallet: When you first visit the DApp, you'll be prompted to connect your Ethereum wallet (e.g., MetaMask).

Start Mining: Once the wallet is connected, you can start mining by clicking on the "Start Mining" button. The progress bar will show the percentage of tokens mined.

Claim Tokens: After the mining process is completed, the "Claim Token" button will be activated, allowing you to claim the mined tokens.

View History: All mining and claiming activities are logged in the history section for easy tracking.

Contract Functions
Mine: Starts the mining process and emits a minelog event.

Claim: Claims the mined tokens and emits a claimlog event.

Security Considerations
Ensure that you are interacting with the correct contract address.

Always use a secure Ethereum wallet and protect your private keys.

The contract uses require to ensure that users cannot start mining multiple times or claim tokens before the specified interval.
